# Customization System

A modular **character and weapon customization system** built in **Unreal Engine**, focused on data-driven design, scalable UI architecture, and real-time feedback.  
This project demonstrates how complex customization workflows can be implemented cleanly using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system.

A gameplay **showreel** is included to showcase the customization flow and real-time updates.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This system allows players to customize both **characters and weapons** through a structured UI workflow.  
All customization options are driven by centralized data assets, enabling easy extension and maintenance without hardcoded logic.

---

## ✨ Features

- Character appearance customization
- Multi-level weapon and gun customization
- Real-time visual and stat updates
- Data-driven item definitions using Data Tables
- Modular UI components designed for reuse
- Persistent customization state across menus and maps

---

## 🧠 Data-Driven Architecture

- Custom **Data Structures** define item attributes and configuration
- **Data Tables** act as the single source of truth for customization data
- UI elements dynamically populate based on selected data entries
- Changes reflect instantly without manual UI refresh logic

This approach allows new customization options to be added with minimal Blueprint changes.
